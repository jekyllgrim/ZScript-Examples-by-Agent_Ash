A chaingun with an overheat mechanic. Comes with two custom sprites that are also free to use
but are designed specifically to work with vanilla Doom Chaingun.

This shows how a separate sprite layer can be used to represent the barrels heating up.
Heat gain/decay is controled by constants defined in the class.

Use "give ChaingunOverheat" to get the gun and test.
