A simple tripmine weapon. Comes with a weapon, a Tripmine actor that 
draws a beam and explodes if another actor crosses it, and a very
basic ammo type for the weapon.

Very simplistic sprites cobbled via TEXTURES using Doom textures
as a base (not included).

Uses Doom sounds (not included); see SNDINFO.
