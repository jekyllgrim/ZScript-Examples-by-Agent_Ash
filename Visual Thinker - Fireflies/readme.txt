An example for using the VisualThinker class to spawn flies around a spot.

Comes with two actors:
- A map-placeable customizable fly spawner
- A test version of the TechLamp that spawns 3 flies around itself.

Flies can be made fullbright and take any animated texture. Attached example
textures (extremely simplistic 3-pixel flies).
