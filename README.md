# ZScript examples by Agent_Ash

This page is a collection of small random examples I've compiled for various use cases, mainly answering questions, or illustrating behaviors for the ZDoom Wiki. The purpose of this repository is to have them all in one place and under one clear license.

All of these examples are under the MIT license, which means anyone can use them for any purpose, the only requirement being that I should be credited by name. The easiest option is to simply include my [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) file into your project.

Each example is in a separate folder and is meant to function standalone. Each comes with a readme; some code is also commented.
